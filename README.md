# Military-Time
You want to convert the time from a 12 hour clock to a 24 hour clock. If you are given the time on a 12 hour clock, you should output the time as it would appear on a 24 hour clock.  
Determine if the time you are given is AM or PM, then convert that value to the way that it would appear on a 24 hour clock.
